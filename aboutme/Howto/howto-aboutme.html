            What did I create?
        </h4>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p> I made a webpage that explains some information about who I am and what some of my hobbies/interests are, as well as a to-be-completed list of my accomplishments in coding. A picture of myself takes up the center of the screen, immediately
                catching the viewer's eye and making it clear that the page is <strong>about me.</strong><img class="images" src="../aboutme/indexscreencap.png" style="width:70%" /> </p>

        <h4>
            How does my project work overall?
        </h4>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p> My page works through the magial energy of HTML/CSS. Harnessing this mystical art has granted me tremendous, potentially world-shattering power. The majority of the formatting is made through the manipulation of the margins and positions through
                CSS, but the basic elements of the page (the images, text, headers, rickrolls, etc.) are all done through HTML.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>
            What are some specifics of the code and how do they work?
        </h4>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p> My project was created with HTML/CSS (Hypertext Markup Language/Cascading Style Sheets), and is my first real endeavor into what I can actually do with the langauge. As such, my code is basic but quite extensive. Here, I will showcase the code that I have used most frequently and to greatest
                effect, as well as my understanding of how the code works. </p>
            <h3 align=center> The fundamentals: an introduction </h3>
            <p> Headers are some of the most common tags that determine the actual text in html, and are thus nearly guaranteed to be some of the most important, or at least common, building blocks of any given internet page. Headers are an example of what's
                called an HTML "tag". Tags are the most basic part of HTML, and they are used just about every aspect of coding with HTML. Tags are the things that create or add additional components (such as links to other pages) to HTML "elements",
                the stuff you see when you look at a page. Headers are the big text, the text that makes you think "oh look! that thing is important, I better read it!" Above, I have included a medium size header that says "The fundamentals: an introduction".
                This was done using HTML. CSS, however, is an entirely different beast. CSS can be used to control nearly every cool stylistic aspect of the text or the page, including background color, font size, text color, font family (comic sans for
                life), and so, so much more. Margins and padding can be used to manipulate the space that a given element takes up and thereby change where the text appears, borders can be used to emphasize key parts of the website or just generally spice
                it up, animations can be made, text can be formatted, really any number of cool stylistic things can be manipulated to style the page. It's this manipulation of tags such as headers that makes HTML/CSS the powerhouse of a language hybrid
                that it is, and it's HTML/CSS that makes my site possible.</p>

            <h3 align=center>HTML/CSS: hOW DO?</h3>
            <p>If I went over every aspect that I know about HTML/CSS, then I might be spending hours upon hours just writing out garbage. I don't want to inflict that upon either you or me, so I will only go over the real basic basics and the things that
                I think are the most important and relevant for my project. <br> <img class="images" src="../aboutme/screenshotpopo.png" /> <br> ^?^?^ </p>
            <h3 align=center style="font-size:100%">Tags: Paragraphs, Headers, etc.</h3>
            <p>Paragraphs and headers - in this how to page, literally every ASCII character in the entire page is withing either a paragraph (p) or header (h#) tag. These tags make text appear and can also do cool stylistic things if the tags have CSS attached
                to them.</p>
            <h3 align=center style="font-size:100%">Nesting tags - DIVS!</h3>
            <p> While paragraphs and headers are examples of HTML tags which directly create things on your screen which you can see. However, this is not the only type of HTML tag. Lists are tags which only actually affect the tags which are <strong>nested</strong>within
                them To nest a tag, all you need to do is put a tag in between the starting thingy and ending thingy of another tag, and anything that effects things in that tag will in turn effect your nested tag. Nesting tags is one of the most important
                aspects of HTML for one huge reason: the "div" tag. When a div (division) tag is used, it does literally nothing on its own. It has zero properties on its own, and affects nothing unless it has some kind of influence on it. The only reason
                for a div tag to exist is to nest HTML tags within it so that they can be altered by the properties put onto the div tag. Div tags can be nested within div tags, and they are one of, if not the most common and influential tag in HTML.
                Div tags aren't the only tag that uses nesting and is near useless without nesting, but it's the most well-known and therefore the most useful for this example. <br> <img class="images" src="https://www.webdesign.org/img_articles/14296/6.jpg"
                /> <br> You can see five divisions in this google image search result, with blank space inside each (except the one that will affect them all, "main-wrap") for the creator to insert more tags and information to make their website.</p>
            <h3 align=center style="font-size:100%">Margins: Boxes within Boxes</h3>
            <p>Every HTML tag that actively puts something real onto the screen that can alter what the viewer sees is contained within a kind of special box. This box is the stuff that separates your tag from the rest of the elements you see on the screen,
                but it isn't that simple. This box is actually made up of three components-the content (the stuff you see), the padding (the distance in between the content and the border), and the margin (the distance between the rest of your page).
                <img style="border:0px" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A6YUp.png" class="images" /> <br> Each of these boxes can be altered by themselves in order to manipulate the space that a given tag takes up on the screen as well as stylistic things
                such as background color and the cool borders that I put on my images and the main body of this page itself.</p>
            <h3 align=center style="font-size:100%">What's the deal with all these colors?</h3>
            <p>Colors can be altered in almost any HTML element, whether it be the background of a given space, the text itself, the border, or anything else really. They can be changed using either HTML or CSS through various color changing commands, with
                HTML supporting over a hundred pre-set colors until it's required to use hexadecimal codes or RGB in order to pick a specific color of your choice.</p>
            <h3 align=center style="font-size:100%">Backgrounds - How and Why</h3>
            <p>Backgrounds look cool-if you're making a page, you should have a background that looks stylistically nice and suitable for your content. There are at least two ways (to my knowledge) to make a background (for your main body section) in HTML/CSS.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Background colors</li>
                Static background colors can be selected and changed through the aformentioned ways of color choosing using either HTML or CSS (in HTML you can use the bgcolor command in the main body tag, and in CSS it's the same but the command is "background-color:").
                <li>Background images</li>
                Background images can be selected through links to images downloaded by you or image url links from the internet, and use url("") to find the image you want. They can be transformed with many css commands, such as background-size, background-attachment,
                and background repeat.
            </ol>
            <h3 align=center style="font-size:100%">My Personal Process</h3>
            <p>I don't really have a specific style or process that I use consistently when I code, probably because I've been coding for such a short amount of time. When I code, my general way of making it happen is to simply write some words, format them
                using CSS and divs to make them look nice, and then spice them up with some personal touches.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>
            What choices did I make and how did I go about making them?
        </h4>
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p>I made so many choices that I don't think it would be possible to document them all without taking more time writing about my choices than actually making and designing the entire page. With this in mind, I will showcase only the cnoices that
                really stand out to me as the designer.</p>
            <h3 align=center> The Background </h3>
            <p>The background of my page was possibly the easiest to make of the influential choices in the website. Originally, I had chosed a dark, kind of gloomy image to use as my background. That looked bad so I decided that I would rather use a background
                that seems more light and fluffy to compliment the icons I chose through opposing colors. I google searched "background", found one that looked nice, and used it.<br> <img class="images" src="https://fullhdpictures.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blur-Desktop.jpg"
                    style="height:250px"></p>
            <h3 align=center> The Icons </h3>
            <p>Mr. Hesby actually helped me a lot with these-not by actually choosing the icons, but by giving me the idea to have them in the first place. He explained to me that well-organized pages are easy on the eyes, make it easy to find what you're
                looking for, and use multimedia elements to help showcase their information. I saw that my tables seemed a bit like daunting walls of text, and my page needed some more content. Because google is my best friend, it took less than fifteen
                minutes to find and insert some simple icons with invisible background relevant to my interests and the content of the page. <br> <img class="images" style="width: 20%; margin-top:3%" src="https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/helmet-1/154/helmet-mask-goalie-hockey-game-safety-512.png"
                />
            </p>
            <h3 align=center> The Text Blocks </h3>
            <p>
                Moving on from stylistic choices, the text blocks themselves carry within them the majority of the actual content of the page. Therefore, it's my responsility to make them as visually accessible and as informative as possible with my ability. I decided
                to make a symmetrical design, keeping the main picture of me in the middle and putting the boxes that explain who I am and what I've done to the sides. This makes a generally appealing effect (at least to me), and maximizes the space efficiency
                of my website while still looking minimal in design. Because of this, I was able to make my site only take up a total of one page from a chromebook, no scrolling necessary. The headers located above the boxes and the small images below
                make an sleek effect that I think looks quite nice. <br> <br><img class="images" src="../aboutme/indexscreencap.png" />

            <p> Before this project, I had nearly zero experience with coding of any kind, HTML/CSS or otherwise. Through this project I have learned, I think, most of the basics of the language(s). I had no idea what I was doing, but now I have at least
                a small idea. Go me!</p>

            <p> I would add some more real content to the page because right now it doesn't have much aside from styling and a couple lists. I think it would look much more professional/developed if it had some more information about what I've done, but I
                can't actually include more than I have because I am very boring.
